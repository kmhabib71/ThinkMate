Create a Next.js landing page for an app called ThinkMate, a note-taking and AI writing assistant tool. Use Tailwind CSS for styling. The page should have a hero section with a background image, a headline ("Welcome to ThinkMate"), a subheadline ("Your AI-powered writing companion"), and a call-to-action button ("Get Started"). Include a basic footer. Save the code in src/app/page.tsx and ensure itâ€™s responsive. Generate a src/app/globals.css file with Tailwind imports and basic reset styles. Also, create a public/images/hero-bg.jpg placeholder reference and a minimal railway.json for deployment.
